# US-Visa-Approval-Prediction


## About The Project

The process of obtaining a US visa can be daunting and uncertain for many applicants, with approval often contingent on numerous factors ranging from personal demographics to travel history. The lack of transparency in the decision-making process leaves individuals unsure of their chances of success, leading to anxiety and frustration. Addressing this issue requires the development of a predictive model that can accurately assess an applicant's likelihood of visa approval based on relevant features. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide applicants with valuable insights to better navigate the visa application process and improve their chances of success.
